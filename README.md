# Project Title: Do_Something - Personal To-Do List Manager

## Project Description:

**Do_Something** is a web-based personal to-do list manager designed to help users stay organized and manage their tasks efficiently. With a clean and intuitive user interface, this application allows users to easily add, edit, and complete tasks, enabling them to maintain control over their daily activities.

## Key Features:

- **Task Management:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list through a user-friendly input form in the application's header. This ensures that tasks are quickly captured and organized.

- **Mark as Done:** Completed tasks can be marked as done with the "Done" button. Once marked, tasks are visually differentiated from active tasks, helping users track their progress.
